Perplexity measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence, while BLEU score measures the similarity between the generated text and a reference text. Human evaluation involves having human judges rate the quality of the generated text based on factors such as coherence, fluency, and relevance. It is recommended to use a combination of these metrics for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.\",\n",
